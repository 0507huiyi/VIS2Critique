    <h2>Introduction</h2>


    <div>
        <p>The WHO air quality database compiles data on ground measurements of annual mean concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter of a diameter equal or smaller than 10 μm (PM10) or equal or smaller than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) which aim at representing an average for the city or town as a whole, rather than for individual stations. Both groups of pollutants originate mainly from human activities related to fossil fuel combustion.
            <br> <br> The database currently hosts data on air quality for over 6000 human settlements in more than 100 countries from 2011 to 2016

            <p>Although PM is measured at many thousands of locations throughout the world, the amount of monitors in different geographical areas vary, with some areas having little or no monitoring. In order to produce global estimates at high resolution (0.1◦ grid‐cells), additional data is required. Annual urban mean concentration of PM2.5 is estimated with improved modelling using data integration from satellite remote sensing, population estimates, topography and ground measurements
